        description: "Cis-to-trans ratio is computed as the ratio of long-range cis reads (>20kb) to trans reads plus long-range cis reads. Typically, cis-to-trans ratio higher than 40% is required. Percentage of long-range cis reads is the ratio of long-range cis reads to total number of reads. Minimum 15% is required and 40% or higher suggests a good library(doi:10.1016/j.cell.2014.11.021). Convergence is determined as standard deviation of proportions of four read orientations to be <0.002 (Very good) or <0.05 (Good) (See section Proportion of read orientation versus genomic separation in the pairsqc_report file under pairs/QC/). The slope of log10 contact probability vs distance between 10kb ~ 300kb representing TAD is also provided as well.
